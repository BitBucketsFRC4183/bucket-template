# Bucket-Template
TODO actually write stuff here

## Project Structure
- bucket-bootstrap - robot project. everything else breaks if you remove this because it supplies dependencies from gradlerio plugin to the other modules without sharing the whole plugin, saving precious build time
- bucket-lib - library of cool stuff that i think is useful
- bucket-shared - important shared data for this year's robot
